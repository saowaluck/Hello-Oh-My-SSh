brew install wget
brew cask install iterm2
```

## Zsh
We'll install zsh for all the features offered by oh-my-zsh. The installation and usage is really intuitive. We will also create the file env.sh, it is a config file we maintain so as to not pollute the ~/.zshrc too much. env.sh holds aliases, exports, path changes etc. and you can find it at the bottom of this page.

## OSX - Install Oh-My-ZSH - with Curl
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

```

## How to Set up
```
vi ~/.zshrc
ZSH_THEME= "<Theme-Name>"
```
